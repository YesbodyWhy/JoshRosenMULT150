/*
 * The first edit I made, was to the "Size Over Lifetime" Values, by making The size over lifetime start at 0, ramp up to its max value, then slowly shrink down to 0 once more!
 * Secondly, I changed the "Color Over Lifetime" field to include A purple which fades to a pink before ending on white, and changed the "Rate over Time" to 110.
 * Thirdly, I changed the "Velocity Over Lifetime" field to make it spiral by changing Orbital Axis to (0,0,-2), Linear Y to 11, and changed the speed modifier to 0.9.
 * Fourthly, I added the trails, and made their "Width OVer Trail" property get thicker over time with the curve editor!
 * Lastly, I changed the emission shape to be thicker on the bottom by increasing its angle to 90! YAY MAGIC PORTAL!!
