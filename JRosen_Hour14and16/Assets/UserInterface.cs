/* Starting off with a basic idea of a "false game" (inspired by the assignment essentially telling us to create the illusion of a game behind a title
 * screen that doesn't exist) I ran wild! I put a lot more time into this than I probably should have!
 * Firstly, I imported the Seven - Eleven Font, A VHS Font, and a pixelated font to add variety to the text in this false game! 
 * I wanted this false game to be enticing and convincing as well, so I ran with the idea and created four (technically six but the fifth one
 * looks absolutely terrible, and for some reason the sixth one's textures just didn't want to cooperate when imported into Unity, maybe a UV issue?) 
 * fish models to be used for the title screen! Using the Screen Space - Camera Overlay, I separated the Canvas into two!
 * One Canvas was named BG for "Background" and included the background elements! Then there was the aptly titled "FrontCanvas" which contained text
 * and the like. Sandwiched in between the two of these were the Fish Models! Then, on the other side, I overlaid a PSA announcement screen, colored
 *  monotone red of course, with a Stock image of a man in distress! I also wanted to create a funny but dissonant song, so I whipped this tiny loop
 *  up in FL! Then, to add a bit of humor, I made it act like pressing the wrong button would give you "liquid blood disorder", which is just having
 *  normal blood WOMP WOMP! */
