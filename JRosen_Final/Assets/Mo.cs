Modifications - 


1. Added a Directional Light in the workspace. Made the color off grey to make it seem dark, but things still visible. To add to this effect, changed the intensity to 0.6.
2. Added a darkening fog to make a pseudo vignette around the newly fixed camera. (Made black, linear, etc.)
3. New skybox added, changed lighting to make everything seem fluorescent, and edited the intensity multiplier of the skybox lighting itself.
4. Chaos balls converted into prefabs which were isntantiated throughout the scene manually into the "Chaos Balls"
5. Added folders for the Chaos Ball prefabs.
6. New textures include the wrestling ring and the fighting glove, alogn with the arrows.
7. Added variable particle system for glove, which changes intensity, lifetime, and startspeed inside of the new DragToMove Script.
8. Added spotlight to glove the faster the glove goes when dragged.
9. WrestlingRing is already a packaged prefab. Although the hitboxes are separate objects in the "Walls" GameObject.
10. Each band of the wrestling ring is red and blue respectively.
11. THIS GAME IS FUNCTIONAL! I WANT THE CAMERA TO MOVE THAT WAY IT ISNT BROKEN! NOW, YOU HAVE TO DRAG YOUR MOUSE TO MOVE THE GLOVE! (took lots of time, but I think I got a functional build!)
